# IgorAcq
Acquisition code used by Folk Lab

How to use the IgorAcq repo:
- Create a new branch before making any changes to existing files.
- Publish the new branch (Push it to the repo).
- Create a pull request, that will merge your new branch with the Master branch.
- When the code Admin (for now Tim & Johann) approves the new code, they will merge the branches.
- DO NOT commit changes directly to the Master branch!

Just ask if you have questions!:)
